## R Scripts to Demonstrate Use of the SoilR Package to Model Soil OC and 14C

This repository contains a R script and related files to be used in Geography/Soil Science 525 (Soil Geomorphology). Students will access the scripts through Binder. The script used here was written by Joe Mason using the SoilR package to model soil organic carbon, 14C, and stable C isotopic composition of organic C in two horizons of a soil that initially formed under prairie, later replaced by forest. See comments in R script for more details. 

Based on research funded by the National Science Foundation, grant BCS-1263582.

The SoilR package was developed by Carlos A. Sierra and Markus Mueller, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/SoilR/SoilR.pdf" target="_blank" </a>
